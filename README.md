## âš  This project was renamed and moved here: https://github.com/maddsua/lambda-lite

Reason? This name is kinda dumb and is too cheeky. Yeah it's fun to say it outlout on Railwayapp's server and confuse the shit out of Brody (hi legend ðŸ‘‹) and my collegues giggle everytime they hear it too buuuut itâ€™s somewhat hard to explain to customers and technically this project is just less confusing that way
